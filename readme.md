# JSON Fixer

A lightweight, high-performance JSON repair utility designed specifically for handling malformed JSON, with special consideration for LLM output processing.

## Why Another JSON Fixer?

While solutions like [json_repair](https://github.com/mangiucugna/json_repair) exist, JSON Fixer was created to address specific needs:

- **Performance**: Optimized for speed with parallel processing capabilities
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed error tracking for each malformed character
- **LLM Focus**: Specifically designed to handle common JSON issues in LLM outputs
- **Memory Efficient**: Lightweight implementation without excessive loop iterations
- **Caching**: Implements LRU caching for repeated patterns

## Features

- üöÄ High-performance parallel processing for large JSON files
- üìù Detailed error tracking with position information
- üîÑ Handles common JSON formatting issues:
  - Unmatched quotes and brackets
  - Trailing commas
  - Missing colons
  - Invalid number formats
- üíæ LRU caching for repeated JSON patterns
- üßµ Thread-safe batch processing
- üìä Memory efficient implementation

## Installation

```bash
pip install json-fixer  # Coming soon to PyPI
```

## Quick Start

```python
from jason_fixer import JsonFixer

# Simple usage
fixer = JsonFixer()
result = fixer.load_json('{"key": "value",}')  # Note the trailing comma
print(result.fixed)  # {"key":"value"}

# Batch processing
jsons = [
    '{"key1": "value1"}',
    '{"key2": "value2",}',  # Malformed
    '{"key3": "value3"}'
]
results = JsonFixer.batch_process(jsons)

# File processing
result = JsonFixer.from_file('data.json')
```

## Error Tracking

```python
fixer = JsonFixer(logging=True)
result = fixer.load_json('{"key": "value"')
print(result.get_errors())  # Shows missing closing brace position
```

## Performance

- Parallel processing for large JSON files
- LRU caching for repeated patterns
- Optimized string parsing
- Minimal memory footprint

## Testing

Run the test suite using pytest:

```bash
pytest test_json_fixer.py
```

Example test cases:

```python
# Basic JSON repairs
def test_basic_json_repairs(json_fixer):
    assert json_fixer.repair_json('{key: value}') == {"key": "value"}
    assert json_fixer.repair_json('{"key": value}') == {"key": "value"}

# Array parsing
def test_array_parsing(json_fixer):
    cases = [
        ('[1,2,3]', '[1,2,3]'),
        ('[test, 2, three]', '["test",2,"three"]')
    ]
    for input_json, expected in cases:
        result = json_fixer.load_json(input_json)
        assert result.fixed == expected
```
